#IoT : getting started with MQTT

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a simple messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices with low-bandwidth. So, it's the perfect solution for Internet of Things applications. MQTT allows you to send commands to control outputs, read and publish data from sensor nodes and much more.

This is a small series of sample codes to get started with IoT using MQTT. These simple test codes are for demonstrating how MQTT clients work in different devices/nodes.
Here I've included sample codes for MQTT clients in Browser, NodeJS server, Python-RaspberryPI, ESP8266-Arduino and a simple HTTP-MQTT bridge.
